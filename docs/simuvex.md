# Semantic Meaning

Most analyses require an understanding of what the code is *doing* (semantic meaning), not just what the code *is* (syntactic meaning).
For this, we developed a module called SimuVEX (https://github.com/angr/simuvex). SimuVEX provides a semantic understanding of what a given piece of VEX code does on a given machine state.

In a nutshell, SimuVEX is a VEX emulator.
Given a machine state and a VEX IR block, SimuVEX provides a resulting machine state (or, in the case of condition jumps, *several* resulting machine states).

## Semantic Translation

SimuVEX's ultimate goal is to provide a semantic meaning to blocks of binary code. Let's grab a motivating example, from the angr testcases.

This is the function that we'll be looking at:
```c
	// cat fauxware.c | tail -n+9 | head -n 17
	int authenticate(char *username, char *password)
	{
		char stored_pw[9];
		stored_pw[8] = 0;
		int pwfile;
	
		// evil back d00r
		if (strcmp(password, sneaky) == 0) return 1;
	
		pwfile = open(username, O_RDONLY);
		read(pwfile, stored_pw, 8);
	
		if (strcmp(password, stored_pw) == 0) return 1;
		return 0;
	
	}
```
Here is the native AMD64 code:

	# objdump -d /home/angr/angr/tests/blob/x86_64/fauxware

This might seem a bit crazy; there's certainly a lot of IR.
As you can see from the assembly, this block sets up the first strcmp call.
While the IR gives us syntactic meaning (i.e., what statements the block containts), SimuVEX can provide us semantic meaning (i.e., what the block *does* to a given state).
We'll now move on to how to do that.

## Accessing SimIRSBs

We get semantic meaning by converting an IRSB into a SimIRSB.
While the former focuses on providing a cross-architecture, programmatically-accessible representation of what a block is, the latter provides a cross-platform, programmatically-accessible representation of what a block did, given an input state.

The supported way of creating SimIRSBs is by using Paths.
Here's an example.

```python
# This creates a SimIRSB at 0x400664, and applies it to a blank state (which is automatically created by blank_path)
>>> p = b.factory.path(addr=0x400664)
>>> p.step()
>>> sirsb = p.next_run

# this is the address of the first instruction in the block
>>> assert sirsb.addr == p.addr
```

Now that we have the SimIRSB, we can retrieve two main pieces of semantic information: what the block did, and where execution will go next.

## SimProcedures

TODO

## Breakpoints!

Like any decent execution engine, SimuVEX supports breakpoints. This is pretty cool! A point is set as follows:

```python
# get our state
>>> import simuvex

>>> s = b.factory.entry_state()

# add a breakpoint. This breakpoint will drop into ipdb right before a memory write happens.
>>> s.inspect.b('mem_write')

# on the other hand, we can have a breakpoint trigger right *after* a memory write happens. On top of that, we
# can have a specific function get run instead of going straight to ipdb.
>>> def debug_func(state):
...     print "State %s is about to do a memory write!"

>>> s.inspect.b('mem_write', when=simuvex.BP_AFTER, action=debug_func)

# or, you can have it drop you in an embedded ipython!
>>> s.inspect.b('mem_write', when=simuvex.BP_AFTER, action='ipython')
```

There are many other places to break than a memory write. Here is the list. You can break at BP_BEFORE or BP_AFTER for each of these events.

| Event type        | Event meaning |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| mem_read          | Memory is being read. |
| mem_write         | Memory is being written. |
| reg_read          | A register is being read. |
| reg_write         | A register is being written. |
| tmp_read          | A temp is being read. |
| tmp_write         | A temp is being written. |
| expr              | An expression is being created (i.e., a result of an arithmetic operation or a constant in the IR). |

These events expose different attributes:

| Event type        | Attribute name     | Attribute availability | Attribute meaning                        |

| reg_write         | reg_write_offset   | BP_BEFORE or BP_AFTER  | The offset of the register being written. |
| reg_write         | reg_write_length   | BP_BEFORE or BP_AFTER  | The length of the register write. |
| reg_write         | reg_write_expr     | BP_BEFORE or BP_AFTER  | The expression that is being written. |
| tmp_read          | tmp_read_num       | BP_BEFORE or BP_AFTER  | The number of the temp being read. |

| statement         | statement          | BP_BEFORE or BP_AFTER  | The index of the IR statement (in the IR basic block). |
| instruction       | instruction        | BP_BEFORE or BP_AFTER  | The address of the native instruction. |
| irsb              | address            | BP_BEFORE or BP_AFTER  | The address of the basic block. |

| symbolic_variable | symbolic_expr      | BP_AFTER               | The expression representing the new symbolic variable. |

We can put all this together to support conditional breakpoints!
Here it is:

```python
# This will break before a memory write if 0x1000 is a possible value of its target expression
>>> s.inspect.b('mem_write', mem_write_address=0x1000)

# This will break before a memory write if 0x1000 is the *only* value of its target expression
>>> s.inspect.b('mem_write', mem_write_address=0x1000, mem_write_address_unique=True)

# This will break after instruction 0x8000, but only 0x1000 is a possible value of the last expression that was read from memory
>>> s.inspect.b('instruction', when=simuvex.BP_AFTER, instruction=0x8000, mem_read_expr=0x1000)
```

Cool stuff! In fact, we can even specify a function as a condition:
```python
# this is a complex condition that could do anything! In this case, it makes sure that RAX is 0x41414141 and
# that the basic block starting at 0x8004 was executed sometime in this path's history
>>> def cond(state):
...     return state.any_str(state.regs.rax) == 'AAAA' and 0x8004 in state.inspect.backtrace

>>> s.inspect.b('mem_write', condition=cond)
```

That is some cool stuff!
